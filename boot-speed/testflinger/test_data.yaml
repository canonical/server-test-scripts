        # For historical reasons testflinger calls format() on the test_cmds
        # string to fill in certain values if desided. That means it tries to
        # interpret anything between curly braces as a key, so literal curly
        # braces must be escaped by doubling them up.
        #
        # To avoid worrying about escaping and for easiear testing/debugging
        # we keep the string very simple and just pull and run an external
        # script.
